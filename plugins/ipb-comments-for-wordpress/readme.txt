Use IP.Board to manage your comments.

== Description ==

IP.Board Comments for WordPress allows you to use IPB (IP.Board or Invision Power Board) to replace or enhance your WordPress comments. When a new WordPress post is created in a mapped category, it will cross-post to your IPB forum with a link back to the WordPress post. The IPB forum link is saved in a custom field and will appear in the footer of your post.

You may find it much easier to manage comments and users on the forum, rather than using the minimal WordPress comment system.

Your IPB installation must reside on the same server as your WordPress installation.

Requires at least: IP.Board 3.0 and PHP 5.2.6

== Installation ==

I would recommend installing the plugin from your WP Plugins menu.  Do a search for "ipb" and it should come up.  You can update easier in the future this way.  If you prefer to install it manually, see the comments below.

1. Upload all files into the `/wp-content/plugins/ipb-comments-for-wordpress` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the Plugins menu in WordPress
3. Open Settings / IPB Comments submenu and add or edit the settings.

You will need to edit the Base Url, Base Path, Member ID, and enter the IPB category # that corresponds to at least one WordPress category.  The Base Url should lead to your forum's main front page.  The Base Path should be the server path to the same location for your IPB root files.  This will be the directory path to the directory where the initdata.php file is located.  The Member ID should be a valid member ID from your IPB forum, with access to post HTML and access to post in the categories.  Usually, you can enter 1 and it will post as your default admin user.  Create any WordPress categories you need for the blog, and return to the IPB Comments submenu if needed.  You'll notice a list of each WordPress category printed to the right of some empty input blocks.  Enter the IPB category where you wish the new topics to be entered, whenever a WordPress post is made in the WP category shown directly to the right.
